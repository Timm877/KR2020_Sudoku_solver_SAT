Introduction}
\subsection{Propositional Satisfiability}
Propositional Satisfiability (SAT) is a core problem in Artificial Intelligence, as well as in many other areas of Computer Science and Engineering. Given a set of propositional variables and a set of constraints expressed in conjunctive normal form (CNF)), the goal of a SAT problem is finding a variable assignment that satisfies all constraints or prove that no such assignment exists [1].

The SAT solver that is used in this paper is based on 
the original Davis–Putnam–
Logemann–Loveland (DPLL) backtrack search algorithm. The algorithm performs a search process that.....


\subsubsection{Design desicions} the important design decisions for our SAT solver (both how and why). 

\subsubsection{Decision heuristics} We implemented two SAT-based heuristics to solve the SAT problem. The algorithm presented can be adapted to any SAT solver. 

\paragraph{DLIS} The first heuristic we implemented is Dynamic Largest Individual Sum (DLCS)...... 
\paragraph{DLCS} The second heuristic we implemented is Dynamic Largest Combined Sum (DLCS).....

\subsection{Experiment} In this paper we use our SAT-solver to solve a 9 x 9 Sudoku. For a partially filled 9 × 9 grid, the goal is to place numbers 1 to 9 to each cell in such a way that in each row, column, and 3 × 3 sub-grid, each number occurs exactly once...Question is if....

\subsubsection{Hypothese} Based on...we suggest that:
(potential) hypothese 1. 

\subsubsection{Relevance}This is interesting because it gives us insight into human cognition and thinking. It also has important applications in human-computer collaboration and training of problem solving skills, e.g., for developing intelligent tutoring systems [2]
